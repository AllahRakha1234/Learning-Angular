	1) Here [todo] means that from the parent component which is todos here is sending data as property to child component which is todo-item here.
	2) (todoDeleteEvent) is the event emit from child component which todo-item here and will catch by parent component which is todos here to handle it.
	3) Here i the variable in parent or todos component while indx is variable which will be received or declared in child or todo-item component. Same for todo.
		From here we can say that [indx] here indx is a JS/TS variable and "i" is value assigned to it.
